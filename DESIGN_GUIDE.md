# Design Guide

- Color palette: dark charcoal backgrounds, high contrast white/near-white text, subtle gray accents.
- Typography: use system sans-serif for performance; consider Google Fonts for production.
- Motion: subtle entrance/hover animations only; avoid motion sickness — provide reduced-motion prefers.
